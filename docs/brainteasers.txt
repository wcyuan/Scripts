-- PROGRAMMING Very Easy
------------------------------------

Compare enum, const int, #define, struct
  - if you are creating flags, you can #define constants for 1, 2, 4,
    etc., or you can create an enum with values for 1, 2, 4, etc., but
    the best is probably to create a struct of 1 bit fields:
	struct {
	  unsigned int is_foo : 1;
	  unsigned int is_bar : 1;
	  unsigned int is_baz : 1;
          : 1;  // provides padding
	  : 0;  // forces word boundary
	} flags;
    however, struct fields are implementation dependent (whether the
    fields may overlap a word boundary, etc.), so you may want to use
    unnamed fields as padding and the special zero width, which forces
    word boundariess.  

	

OOP: explain virtual, pure virtual.  what are they for? given class B
and class D : B
	B b();
	b.foo();
Which foo runs?  (depends only on if b's foo is virtual)

Three uses of the word 'static'

Given a list of numbers, 1-100, find out which number is missing

What are constructors, destructors, what are they for.  Given an
inheritance tree, in what order are constructors called?  (base class
before derived class).  In what order are destructors called? (derived 
class before base class -- should always be virtual).  If you have
garbage collecting, why do you need a destructor?  (to close open
filestreams and other resources).  

What are member initializers for?  Why don't you just initialize
members in the constructor body?  
If you have a member which is itself a class, its constructor is
called before the class's constructor.  Then, when you initialize the
member, you might initialize it to another instance of the member's
class, so the member's copy constructor may be called.  This is
inefficient.  If you call it in the initialization list, only the copy
constructor is called.

What is amortized time?  How does a vector work?  

When would you want to use a macro?  What are the dangers?
  - compile-time options
  - generating simple code (e.g. writing gettors and settors)
  - things that templates can't handle
    - give a bunch of different classes each a static variable, e.g. a count
  - no type checking
  - may be difficult to debug since it is done in the preprocessor

Write a function to give the permutations of a list.  How about
iteratively (harder)?

Reverse a linked list. (constant space, linear time)

Find a value in a binary tree.

If I define for you:
void swap(int* arr, int i, int j) 
{
    int t = arr[i];
    arr[i] = arr[j];
    arr[j] = t;
}
Write quicksort and bubblesort for integer arrays (in place).

What does the following do:
void mystery(int* arr, int size) 
{
    int i, j = 1, t;
    if (size < 2) return;
    for (i = 1; i < size; i++) 
	if (arr[i] < arr[0]) 
	{
	    t = arr[i];
	    arr[i] = arr[j];
	    arr[j] = t;
	    j++;
	}
    t = arr[0];
    arr[0] = arr[j-1];
    arr[j-1] = t;
    mystery(arr+j,size-j);
    mystery(arr,j);
}
void mystery2(int* arr, int size) 
{
    int i, j, k;
    for(j = size-1; j > 0; j--)
	for (i = 0; i < j; i++)
	    if (arr[i] > arr[i+1])
	    {
		k = arr[i+1];
		arr[i+1] = arr[i];
		arr[i] = k;
	    }
}

Explain different sorts: running time, space, difficulty to
implement.  merge, heap, quick, bubble, selection, insertion, bucket,
radix.  what assumptions are being made?  

Why is clock speed a good/bad indication of processor performance?  

Given a respectable random number generator, how do you shuffle a deck
of cards (arbitrary size) so that every card has equal prob chance of 
being in any given spot.  (linear time).

If you have a good random number generator on the set {0,1} (i.e. a
coin flip), how do you extend this to any set of integers?

What's the difference between lines 3a and 3b?
1	double dval;
2	int ival;
3a	ival += dval;
3b	ival += static_cast< int >(dval);
3b is slightly more efficient.  3a causes ival to be promoted to
double, then there is an addition of doubles, then the result is
truncated to an int and stored in ival.  3b avoids the unnecessary
promotion.  

What is the danger with inline destructors?  
Would have to add the code to every place that an object could
potentially go out of scope, e.g., at every return statement.  Could
get unwieldy if the destructor is large.  

Given a CPU that supports standard bitwise operations (including
shifting) on an n bit word, what is the fastest way to reverse the
bits in such a word?  This is evidently currently a staple of the
nVidia interview, but I think it's a good question for any CS grad.
Divide and conquer!  Best shown with an example:
x = (x & 11110000 >> 4) | (x & 00001111 << 4)		(12345678 -> 56781234)
x = (x & 11001100 >> 2) | (x & 00110011 << 2)		(56781234 -> 78563412)
x = (x & 10101010 >> 1) | (x & 01010101 << 1)		(78563412 -> 87654321)
which is log n time.  Note if mask1 = 11110000 and mask2 = 00001111,
you can generate the next masks with
tmp = mask2 << 2
mask1 = mask1 ^ tmp
mask2 = mask2 ^ tmp
So: 
N = wordsize / 2
mask1 = an entire word full of 0's
mask2 = an entire word full of 1's
while N >= 1
	tmp = mask2 << N
	mask1 = mask1 ^ tmp
	mask2 = mask2 ^ tmp
	x = (x & mask1 >> N) | (x & mask2 << N)
	N=N/2
end

what does (*(void(*)())0)() mean?

Show them a piece of code
	ask them to tell you what it does
	ask them to add something to it.
	ask them to find design flaws/traps 
For example, show them a simple GUI, ask them to add 
a button, and expect them to identify a code block which should be made a 
function.  Expect them to identify quicksort.  Show them flags
implemented as #defines, expect them to suggest enums, consts, or
structs with bit-sized elements.  Show them C and ask them how they
would design the code in OO style.

How do you pass multidimensional arrays into a function in C/C++?
Passing multidimensional arrays into a function requires:

Given an array of numbers, find the subarray with the largest sum in
O(n^2) (trivial), O(n log n) (divide and conquer), O(n).

Given an array of objects on which there is an equality operator (but
no comparison operator) how do you find the majority element (if it
exists) in O(n log n)? O(n)?  Example: you have a bunch of pictures
and "equality" is if they are pictures of them same thing -- not the
same picture, just pictures of the same thing (somehow you have a
smart function that knows this -- it might require user input).  You
can't compare them, and you can't easily hash them (how do you ensure
that two pictures that are of the same thing hash to the same value?).

Bit Commitment.  Use a public key/private key where the lowest bit of
the message is secure.  RSA satisfies this.  Pad your bit with a
salt.  Encode it with your public key.  Give it to the other person.
To reveal it, simply reveal the salt -- the can confirm that
encrypting this with your public key results in the message you gave
them.  

Calculate average without revealing individual numbers: Bob chooses
r[B,A], r[B,S], r[B,K] randomly between 0 and 400. He calculates
r[B,B] so that (r[B,A] + r[B,B] + r[B,S] + r[B,K]) mod 401 is his own
score, 88.  Bob sends r[B,A] to Alice, receives r[A,B]. He sends
r[B,S] to Spot, receives r[S,B]. He sends r[B,K] to Krunch, receives
r[K,B].  Compute c[B] = (r[A,B] + r[B,B] + r[S,B] + r[K,B]) mod
401. Give c[B] to everybody, get c[A],c[S],c[K].  The total is (c[A] +
c[B] + c[S] + c[K]) mod 401.

x-axis, since this is easy to determine.

You have two mirrors set at a 15 degree angle.  A beam of light comes

beam as a particle, so if it hits in point A, hits point B, then
bounces back and hits point A again before escaping forever, that's 3
hits.  
       (answer: 11.  The beam hits the first mirror at an angle of 15
	deg, then hits the second at 30 deg, then hits the first again
	at 45 deg, etc., always adding 15 deg, until it hits at 90, at
	which point it bounces back and hits all of the previous spots
	again.)

----- Susquehanna questions ----------

Drunkard leaves bar. Home is 50 paces to the North, the cliff is 30
paces to the south. Drunkard walks randomly 1 pace N/S. What is
probability that he gets home before he falls of cliff?
At every step it is equally likely that he goes N as S.  For each
step, the expected value of his position is the origin (the bar).  So
after N steps, the expected value of his position still has to be the
bar.  So 50 * prob(home) = 30 * prob(cliff) and prob(home) +
prob(cliff) = 1.  So prob(home) = 3/8 and prob(cliff) = 5/8.

What is rank (A * A_transpose)? (personal favorite - you can either do
a hand-wavy argument for the reals and the complex numbers, basically
every matrix is diagonalizable if you perturb it slightly, have to be

know goes as follows: without loss of generality you can assume the

use Jordan Canonical form).

You know a family has 2 kids, and one is a girl. What is the
probability that they are both girls.
1/3

You know a family has 2 kids; one is called Rachael. What is the
probability they are both girls? 
If P is the probability that a girl is named Rachael then the
probability is (2 - P) / (4 - P).  In the first question, where we
know the family has a girl, a family with one boy and one girl just as
easily satisfies the condition as a family with two girls.  In the
second question, where the family has a Rachael, the family with two
girls is almost twice as likely to have a Rachael than a family with
one boy and one girl.  Note, it has nothing to do with the fact that a
family will probably not have two girls named Rachael, as long as you
assume that there are infinitely many girls' names -- if there are just
a few girls' names, then it changes things again.  

Now say you just know they have 2 kids, and that they are home

You are one of X bidders for an auction.  You decide to bid V.  Then
you are told that there is a new bidder.  Does your bid change?  How?

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- solution to bidding question
------------------------------------

Here is the rigorous solution to the bidding question:


Part of the difficulty of the question is that it's vague and you have to make a lot of assumptions.  These are the usual assumptions that I use:

1. The object has no intrinsic value to you.  The only reason you to want the object is so you can sell it to the third person.  
2. Somehow, if you buy the object, the third person will reveal his price to you in order to buy it from you.  Note, you don't know this beforehand because then you would know my price.  
3. You are risk neutral.  Your only goal is to maximize your expected profit, no matter what the risk.  
4. Since we have no other information, we assume that it is equally likely for the price to be any value between $0 and $100.  

Here is the common sense solution:

Let's say you bid $30.  Then, if I think the value is more than $30, nothing will happen.  If I think the value is between $20 and $30, you will make something between $0 and $10.  If I think the value is between $10 and $20, you will lose something between $0 and $10.  If I think the value is between $0 and $10, you will lose something between $10 and $20.  All of these possibilities are equally likely, and there are more negatives than positives.  So if you bid $30, you will lose money on average.


But, none of the logic relied on the fact that you bid $30.  For any value you bid, one third of the time you will make money, and two thirds of the time you will lose money, and the money you could lose outweighs the money you could make.  So no matter what you bid, you are going to lose money on average.  

So you shouldn't bid anything.  

Here is the mathy solution (sort of tough to read without the proper symbols):

We need to maximize expected profit.  So, figure out the function for profit, take the expected value, and maximize the resulting function.  

Let's call my opinion of the object's value V
So if you owned the object, you could sell it for 1.5 * V.  
Let's call your profit P.  P is a function of what you bid and the object's
value.  Let's say you bid B.  

If V > B, nothing will happen and P=0.
If V < B, I will sell you the object for B (your cost) and you will sell the object for 1.5 * V (your revenue), so your profit is P(B,V) = 1.5 V - B

So P(B,V) 	= 0 		if V > B
		= 1.5 V - B	if V <= B

Now we take the expectation by V, which is evenly distributed between 0 and 100.  Note that since we are taking the expectation by V, we will eliminate V from the function.  The resulting function should be a function of B only.  

E_v[P(B,V)] 	= f(B)
			= integral from 0 to 100 of P(B,V)
			= integral from 0 to B of (1.5 V - B) + integral from B to 100 of 0
			= integral from 0 to B of (1.5 V - B) 
			= (0.75 V^2 - BV) evalulated at v = B minus (0.75 V^2 - BV)  evaluated at v = 0
			= 0.75 B^2 - B^2 minus 0
			= 0.75 B^2 - B^2
			= -0.25 B^2

Now we have to maximize f(B) = -0.25 B^2.  But since B^2 is never negative, -0.25 B^2 is never positive.  So the value B=0, f(B) = 0, is the maximum value.  If you really want to convince yourself, look for the maximum value of f at these points: 
	1. when the derivative is zero 
df/dB = 2*(-0.25)*B = 0 
	<==> B = 0 
	<==> f(B) = 0 
	(this also takes care of one boundary condition) 

	2. at the boundary conditions (B = 0 and B = 100, the first of which is above)
B = 100 
	<==> f(B) = -0.25 * 10,000 = -2,500 < 0

So your bid should be zero. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Data structure with random access, where you can reset all values in
   constant time
------------------------------------

Call the structure ResetArray.  You want to be able to set or access
ResetArray[x], but also run ResetArray.reset() to set everything back
to a default value.  

Three arrays (Data, Index, ReverseIndex) and a counter initialized to
zero.  

To set a value, "ResetArray[x] = v":
   Index[x] = counter;
   RevIndex[counter] = x;
   Data[counter] = v;
   counter++;

To look up a value, "ResetArray[x]":
   index = Index[x]
   if (index >= counter) 
      // This value was left over from before the last time we reset it
      return default_value;
   if (RevIndex[index] != x)
      return default_value;
   return Data[index];

To reset the array to value d, "ResetArray.reset(d)", do:
   default_value = d;
   counter = 0;

The reason you need to check the RevIndex, is because let's say you do
this:
   ResetArray[4] = 1
   // Now Index[4] = 0, RevIndex[0] = 4, Data[0] = 1, counter = 1
   ResetArray.reset();
   // Now Index[4] = 0, RevIndex[0] = 4, Data[0] = 1, counter = 0
   ResetArray[7] = 3
   // Now Index[4] = 0, Index[7] = 0, RevIndex[0] = 7, Data[0] = 3, counter = 1

   // If you didn't have RevIndex, you'd look up the Index of 4 and
   // get 0, then you'd look up the data for 0 and get 3, which is
   // actually the value for 7.  So you have to double check with
   // RevIndex.  
   print ResetArray[4]

------------------------------------

Another way to do it:

Two arrays (Data, Version) and a current_version initialized to 1.  All values
in Version are initialized to zero.  

To set a value, "ResetArray[x] = v":
   Data[x] = v
   Version[x] = current_version

To look up a value, "ResetArray[x]":
   if Version[x] == current_version:
      return Data[x]
   elif Version[x] > current_version:
      throw an error
   else:
      return default_value

To reset the array to value d, "ResetArray.reset(d)", do:
   default_value = d
   current_version++
