Instructions for building Ion3.

Caveat: ion3 is no longer actively supported, so it may be better to
use a different WM anyway.

1. Download ion-3-20090110.tar.gz from http://tuomov.iki.fi/software/

2. Download ion-scripts-3-20090527.tar.gz from http://tuomov.iki.fi/software/

3. Download lua-5.1.5.tar.gz from http://www.lua.org/ftp/
   Note that though lua 5.2 is available, ion3 requires lua 5.1.

4. Install lua.
   a. Unzip and untar lua.
   b. Follow the directions in INSTALL
   c. Run: make linux
      or whatever the appropriate target is.
   d. Run: make local
      This will tell lua to install into the local directory, and not
      into the whole system, assuming you don't have permission to
      install into the whole system.

5. Build ion3.
   a. Unzip and untar ion3
   b. Build instructions are in the README file
   c. Modify ion3/system.mk
      i.   Change the PREFIX variable at the top which indicates where to
           install, assuming again that you want to install it locally, and
           not in the whole system.
      ii.  Change LUA_DIR to point to whereever you installed lua.
      iii. Run: make
           to build
      iv.  Run: make install
           to install to the PREFIX directory

6. Build ion3 scripts
   a. Unzip and untar ion3-scripts

   b. Run install-scripts.sh to create links in $HOME/.ion3/lib to the
      location of the scripts.  Looks like this has to be run while
      you are in the ion-scripts directory, not sure.  Also, you may
      only want to do this if your $HOME/.ion3 directory is currently
      empty.

   c. In $HOME/.ion3/, create links to cfg_ion.lua and
      conans_bindings.lua.

      All cfg_ion.lua does is:
        set META to Control + Alt
        set mousefocus='disabled'  (turn off focus-follows-mouse)
        load emacs_bindings
        load conans_bindings.
