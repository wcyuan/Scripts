In gnome, there are multiple clipboards, one that uses control-c to copy and control-v to paste,
and a separate one that uses selection to copy and middle-click to paste.  I like having these
clipboards merged (so I can select to copy and control-v to paste).  This is mostly because I
got used to doing that when working on a windows machine and vnc'ing to a linux machine.  The easiest
way to get that behavior seems to be by using clipit:
   sudo apt-get install clipit
Running clipit will add an icon to the task bar (next to the clock and volume, etc).  If you right-click
on it and bring up preferences, there is an option to synchronize clipboards.

One feature that Windows has that I wish Mac had is the ability to easily to put windows side-by-side by
dragging the window to the side of the screen to make it take up exactly half of a screen.  Luckily, it's
easy to add that feature to Mac with Better Touch Tool.  http://www.bettertouchtool.net/
 -- Actually, bettertouchtool now costs money (Apr 2016).  I haven't found any other good alternatives.
    There are some that let you move the window to the side of the screen with hotkeys, but I haven't
    gotten dragging to work for those.  Also, once you've snapped it to the side, you can't bring it back
    to the original shape by unsnapping it.

If using zsh, definitely use https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.
 -- Actually, zsh can be slow.  I currently just pick and choose a subset of oh-my-zsh.
