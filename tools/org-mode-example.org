* Org-Mode Cheat Sheet
** Manual: http://orgmode.org/org.html
** Structure
- <Tab>                :: Toggle what can be seen
- Alt-<up>/<down>      :: Move items up or down
- Alt-<left>/<right>   :: Increase/Decrease indent.  On lists, this
     only moves the current item, not children.  To do children too,
     do Alt-Shift-<left>/<right>
- C-<RET>              :: Add a new item to the outline
- C-S-<RET>            :: Add a new TODO item
** Todo items
- C-c C-t              :: Toggle TODO
- C-c C-c              :: Toggle checkboxes
- S-<up>/<down>        :: Move to the next/prev list item
- M-<ret>              :: Insert a new item into a list
- M-S-<ret>            :: Insert a new checkbox into a list
- C-c a t              :: Show a list of all TODO items
  Might need to global-set-key C-ca to org-agenda
- C-c a T WORD         :: show a list of all TODO items in state WORD
** Datetimes
- C-c C-c              :: Normalize timestamps
- C-c .                :: Insert a date into the agenda
- C-c !                :: Insert a date, not in the agenda
- C-u C-c .            :: Insert a datetime into the agenda
- C-u C-c !            :: Insert a datetime, not in the agenda
- Shift-<left>/<right> :: Change a date by a day at a time
** Clocking
- C-c C-x C-i          :: Clock-in
- C-c C-x C-o          :: Clock-out
- C-c C-x C-r          :: Clock Report
** In-Buffer Settings
- +STARTUP: indent     :: This causes org-mode to indent subitems,
     rather than using ** for the second level and *** for the third,
     etc.
- +STARTUP: logdrawer  :: This causes org-mode to hide log messages
      (like timestamps) into a separate drawer
- +TODO: TODO(t!) DONE(d!) :: This specifies the valid values of TODO.
     The ! tells it to add a timestamp when the TODO changes



* The rest of this is mostly just an example

* single-name carry sims [3/6]
** DONE move fake div trades to carry swap
- [X] make sure hedging.py still works
** DONE add carry pnl to result trees [4/4]
- [X] confirm that carry in the pnl plot matches (modulo sim_hedge)
- [X] fix eod prices for carry
- [X] in a carry sim, only Total, Option, and Hedge pnl types
- [X] also change fill source
** DONE add hedging.py result tree to sims
** TODO get rid of div trades [/]
- [ ] fix prices in reporting
- [ ] fix simulation positions for splits
- [ ] change expirations so they book expire trades
  - [ ] add trades for expirations/exercises in production
  - [ ] in sim, add to the end of the simulator
  - [ ] add to assign swap
** TODO change equity_splits to include type 4, so we get GOOG [/]
- [ ] test:
   make marketdata/yuanc its own directory
   - cp -r marketdata/PROD/20140828 marketdata/yuanc
   - ~/proj/eomm/bin/share/nightly_dump_splits.pl -- -i yuanc -date 20140829
   for some reason, it takes 30 minutes
   didn't work, there are some splits that disappeared
** TODO for expirations with no implied, just skip them in sim
* DONE review Josh's code
